\begin{document}
    \begin{abstract}
        This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the 
        document. A brief introduction about the main subject.
    \end{abstract}
    
    After our abstract we can begin the first paragraph, then press ``enter'' twice to start the second one.

    This line will start a second paragraph.

    I will start the third paragraph and then add \\ 
    a manual line break which causes this text to start on a new line 
    but remains part of the same paragraph. 
    % \verb|...| tells LaTeX to treat everything between the pipe characters (|) as verbatim.
    % It's useful whenever you want to display LaTeX commands in the pdf. 
    Alternatively, I can use the \verb|\newline|\newline command to start a new line, which is also part of the same paragraph.
