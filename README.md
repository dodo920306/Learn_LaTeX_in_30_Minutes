# Learn_LaTeX_in_30_Minutes

These are sample .tex files I learned from following the tutorial provided by Overleaf.

Check out https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes for more official information.

Compile scripts are provided for convenience.

## Prerequisite

Please install TeX Live for compiling .tex files.

Check out https://tug.org/texlive/ for more official information.

Notice that the installation could take extremely lots of hours seriously.

Run

```bash
xelatex -v
```

to check if the installation is successful.

## Get Started

Run

```bash
$ ./xelatex.sh <file name>
```

to generate the output of each .tex sample file.

Run

```bash
$ ./xelatex.sh all
```

to generate the output of all of them at once.

Run

```bash
$ ./xelatex.sh clear
```

to reset.
