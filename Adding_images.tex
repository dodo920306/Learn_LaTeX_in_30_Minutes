The universe is immense and it seems to be homogeneous, on a large scale, everywhere we look.

% The \includegraphcs command is provided (implemented) by the graphicx package
% it’s considered best practice to omit the file extension
% because it will prompt LATEX to search for all the supported formats.
% Generally, the graphic’s file name should not contain white spaces or multiple dots;
% it is also recommended to use lowercase letters for the file extension when uploading image files to Overleaf.
\includegraphics{universe}  
 
There's a picture of a galaxy above.
